```

### Installing

Download

```
Open your webserver 'WWW' folder
```

Copy all the files there

```
Cry
```

```
A lot
```

I wont take the car in this conditions, it would be better to hide in a corner, under a blanket, with light turned off. This is not a nightmare buddy, I am sorry

## Running the tests

Just told you, don't run the test, just run away as far as you can, burning your router is cool too.

### Break down into end to end tests

Google for: 'Anty suicidial hotline'

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines
```

### And coding style tests

NO WAY, why are you still here?

```
Y)Hi, my NAME is ... I really would like to kill my self!
O)Why? what's up?
Y)I just saw too much spaghetti code in one line of code!
O)Oh, it happens, this is not so dangerous.
Y)It was Sliding-tap-list!
O)Here is my gun, don't waste any bullet I'll need one too.

```
